# Geometry of Disturbance

*A generative model of spatial structure from temporal interference.*

This project demonstrates how two orthogonal time axes—interpreted as proper time and observer time, can generate emergent spatial patterns through directional sinusoidal superposition. The resulting field exhibits quasiperiodic order, rotational symmetry, and dynamic structure.

Inspired by theoretical exploration in emergent spacetime physics, the model supports visualizations of temporal interference, with potential links to gravitational behavior, matter formation, and extradimensional geometry.
